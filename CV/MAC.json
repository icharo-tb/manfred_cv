I normally work with Python as my main language and SQL for query language as well as other tools such as PySpark, Pandas and NumPy, Databricks and Git among others, which I’m using to work on my personal GitHub project. Not only that but, I’m a self-taught learner in Korean and most of my English level, I also took part as a volunteer on a charity market. Furthermore, I consider myself as a really curious person that loves to learn and keep improving myself.",
